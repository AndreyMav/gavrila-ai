  n8nio/n8n
```

### 3. Configure GitHub Repository Secrets
1. Go to your GitHub repository > Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
2. Add the following secret:
   - `AUGMENT_TOKEN` - Your Augment session authentication token (REQUIRED)

### 4. Import n8n Workflows
1. Access your n8n instance at `https://your-n8n-domain.com`
2. Import the workflow files from the `n8n/` directory:
   - `Gavrila - Hooks.json` - Main webhook handler for Slack commands
   - `Gavrila - Ask.json` - AI task processing and GitHub Actions orchestration
   - `Gavrila - Configure.json` - Repository configuration (update with your values)
   - `Gavrila - Task Ops.json` - Task validation and creation
   - `Gavrila - Respond.json` - Response handling back to Slack
3. **Important**: Update the configuration in `Gavrila - Configure.json`:
   - `repository_url` - Set to your GitHub repository URL
   - `authorized_slack_user_ids` - Comma-separated list of authorized Slack user IDs (e.g., `U09LHK2NA3T,U12345678`)
   - `default_task_system` - Set to `github` or `linear` depending on your task management system

## How It Works

### Workflow Architecture

1. **Slack Command** → User sends a slash command (e.g., `/gavrila Fix the login bug`) in Slack
2. **n8n Webhook** → `Gavrila - Hooks` receives the command and performs authorization check:
   - Validates that the requesting user's Slack user ID is in the `authorized_slack_user_ids` list
   - If unauthorized, responds with "Sorry, I don't know you well enough." and stops processing
   - If authorized, sends acknowledgment to Slack and continues
3. **Task Processing** → `Gavrila - Ask` workflow:
   - Uses OpenAI to proofread and clarify the task instructions
   - Ensures a task exists (creates if needed)
   - Triggers GitHub Actions workflow `auggie-task.yml`
4. **GitHub Actions** → `auggie-task.yml` workflow:
   - Parses task context (from GitHub issue if provided)
   - Creates or switches to appropriate branch
   - Runs Augment Code agent with the task instructions
   - Commits and pushes changes
   - Reports back to n8n webhook
5. **Response** → `Gavrila - Respond` sends completion notification back to Slack

### n8n Workflow Details

The system uses several key n8n workflow configurations:

- **Webhook Nodes** - Receive incoming requests from Slack and GitHub Actions
- **GitHub Nodes** - Trigger GitHub Actions workflows and interact with repository
- **Slack Nodes** - Send messages, acknowledgments, and status updates
- **OpenAI Nodes** - Proofread task instructions and improve clarity
- **Execute Workflow Nodes** - Chain workflows together for complex operations

Workflow files are located in the `n8n/` directory and can be imported directly into your n8n instance. Each workflow handles a specific aspect of the automation pipeline.

## Setting up n8n Credentials

### Creating Credentials in n8n
1. Navigate to your n8n instance > **Credentials** section
2. Click **"Create New Credential"**
3. Select the appropriate credential type:
   - **GitHub API** - Use your GitHub Personal Access Token
   - **Slack API** - Use your Slack Bot Token
   - **OpenAI API** - Use your OpenAI API Key
4. Paste the API key/secret in the appropriate field
5. **Test the credential** using a sample node to verify connectivity
6. Save the credential with a descriptive name

### Documentation Links
- [n8n Credentials Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/credentials/)
- [n8n General Documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/)

### Service-Specific Setup
- **GitHub**: Configure webhook URLs in repository settings if needed
- **Slack**: Install the Slack app in your workspace and configure slash commands
- **OpenAI**: Ensure sufficient API credits and rate limits

## Required API Key Permissions / Scopes

### GitHub
- `repo` - Full repository access (required for private repos)
- `workflow` - Trigger and manage GitHub Actions workflows
- `contents:write` - Push commits and create branches (automatically granted to GitHub Actions)
- `admin:repo_hook` - Manage repository webhooks (if webhook setup needed)
- `read:org` - Read organization data (if using organization repos)

### Augment Code
- Valid Augment session authentication token
- Access to Augment Code API
- Sufficient usage quota for AI-powered coding tasks

### Slack
- `chat:write` - Send messages and replies in channels and threads
- `channels:read` - Discover channel IDs and basic channel information
- `channels:history` - Read message history (if needed for context)
- `chat:write.public` - Post to public channels without being a member
- `commands` - Handle slash commands
- **Note**: Ensure thread replies are supported by using `thread_ts` parameter

### OpenAI
- Standard API access with sufficient usage limits
- Access to GPT models

## GitHub Actions Workflow

The main automation is powered by `.github/workflows/auggie-task.yml`, which:

### Workflow Inputs
- `taskJson` - JSON string containing task context (from GitHub issue or Slack)
- `branchName` - Optional branch name (auto-generated if not provided)
- `resumeUrl` - n8n webhook URL to report completion status
- `instructions` - Task instructions for the AI agent

### Workflow Steps
1. **Checkout repository** with full git history
2. **Parse task context** from JSON (supports GitHub issues)
3. **Determine branch name** from task context, timestamp, or provided input
4. **Create/switch to branch** and set up git configuration
5. **Build instruction file** with task details, comments, and context
6. **Run Augment Code agent** with the instruction file
7. **Commit and push changes** if any were made
8. **Report status** back to n8n webhook with summary

### Task JSON Format
The workflow accepts task context in the following format:
```json
{
  "task_id": "123",
  "task_system": "github",
  "url": "https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123",
  "title": "Fix login bug",
  "author": "username",
  "state": "open",
  "instructions": "Task description...",
  "comments": [
    {
      "author": "username",
      "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "Comment text..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Security and Access Control

### User Authorization
Gavrila AI includes built-in user authorization to control who can trigger the coding agent:

1. **Configure Authorized Users** in `Gavrila - Configure.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "authorized_slack_user_ids": "U09LHK2NA3T,U12345678,U87654321"
   }
   ```
   - Add comma-separated Slack user IDs of authorized users
   - Leave empty to allow all users (not recommended)

2. **How It Works**:
   - When a Slack slash command is received, the webhook extracts the `user_id` from the request
   - The `Gavrila - Hooks` workflow checks if the user ID is in the authorized list
   - Authorized users: Request proceeds normally
   - Unauthorized users: Receive message "Sorry, I don't know you well enough." and request is rejected

3. **Finding Slack User IDs**:
   - Click on a user's profile in Slack
   - Click "More" → "Copy member ID"
   - The ID format is typically `U` followed by alphanumeric characters (e.g., `U09LHK2NA3T`)

### Additional Security Considerations
- Store all API keys and tokens securely in GitHub Secrets and n8n credentials
- Use HTTPS for all webhook endpoints
- Verify Slack request signatures using the signing secret
- Regularly audit authorized user list and remove inactive users
- Monitor workflow execution logs for suspicious activity

## Slack Slash Commands Integration

Configure Slack slash commands to trigger n8n workflows:

### 1. Create Slack App
1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps and create a new Slack app
2. Enable **"Slash Commands"** in your app features

### 2. Add Slash Command
1. Add a new slash command (e.g., `/gavrila` or `/task`)
2. Set **Request URL** to your n8n webhook endpoint:
   ```
   https://your-n8n-domain/webhook/your-path
   ```
3. Configure method as **POST** with content type `application/json`
4. Ensure the n8n Webhook node accepts the same method and content type

### 3. Install and Configure
1. Install the Slack app into your workspace
2. In n8n, create a Webhook node with matching path and method
3. Connect downstream nodes to process the incoming slash command payload

### 4. Security and Verification
1. Store your **Slack signing secret** securely
2. Verify incoming requests in n8n using the signing secret
3. Use n8n's built-in verification or custom verification logic
4. **User Authorization**: Configure `authorized_slack_user_ids` in `Gavrila - Configure.json`:
   - Add comma-separated Slack user IDs of authorized users (e.g., `U09LHK2NA3T,U12345678`)
   - The webhook will reject requests from unauthorized users with message: "Sorry, I don't know you well enough."
   - To find a user's Slack ID: Click on their profile → More → Copy member ID

### 5. Response Handling
1. **Respond quickly** (within 3 seconds) to avoid Slack timeouts
2. For longer processing, return immediate acknowledgment:
   ```json
   {
     "response_type": "ephemeral",
     "text": "Processing your request..."
   }
   ```
3. Use `response_url` for follow-up messages or separate Slack API calls

### 6. Optional Settings
- **Response visibility**: Use `in_channel` (public) or `ephemeral` (private)
- **Environment variables**: Add `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` and `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`
- **Payload fields**: Expect `command`, `text`, `user_id`, `channel_id`, `response_url`
- **User authorization**: The `user_id` field is used to verify authorized users against the configured list

## Usage and Testing

### Starting the System
1. Ensure n8n workflows are active and running
2. Verify GitHub Actions workflow is enabled in repository settings
3. Confirm GitHub repository secret is configured (`AUGMENT_TOKEN`)
